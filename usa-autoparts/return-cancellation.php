        <h1>Return and Cancellation Policy</h1>

        <p>You may cancel your order at any time before receiving our order confirmation. However, once an order has
            been
            confirmed, it is immediately processed for shipping. Therefore, no orders can be canceled after receiving
            our
            electronic Order Confirmation email. Besides, all orders placed between Fridays, after 5 pm EST (2 pm PST),
            to
            Monday, 9 am EST (6 am PST); cannot be canceled, as they are processed over the weekend for shipment.</p>

        <h1>Returns Policy</h1>

        <p>We will only acknowledge approved returns within 90 calendar days for certain Kool Vue, Replacement, Bolton
            Premiere, Evan Fischer, Garage Pro, StyleLine, N-Dure, Auto Trust, 4WD Pros and Item Auto items, and for
            every
            other item from the date the item was received by the purchaser or original recipient unless otherwise
            indicated
            at the time of purchase.</p>

        <p>All approved returns must be unused and in their original condition, including all items and parts that were
            included in the original package. Items being returned must not have been dismantled, mounted, or damaged
            due to
            incorrect installation or customer error. Carparts.com will not be liable for installation or labor costs,
            towing costs, additional repair costs, or rental vehicle costs incurred due to the use of wrong or
            inadequate
            parts during installation.</p>

        <p>If your shipment arrived with a damaged or incorrect item, please repackage the item(s) in the original
            shipping
            container and refer to our Return Procedure, see below.</p>

        <p>After receiving your order, inspect all packages thoroughly for missing, damaged, or wrong parts. If you
            receive
            a damaged part, DO NOT accept the package, have the shipper immediately return it to the sender. If the
            shipper
            has left a damaged package in your absence, immediately contact the shipping company and have the package
            returned to the sender. Also, please call us immediately if you receive missing, damaged, or incorrect parts
            to
            prevent you from being charged freight on both receipt and return. We are not responsible for missing,
            damaged,
            or incorrect parts after 90 calendar days for certain Kool Vue, Replacement, Bolton Premiere, Evan Fischer,
            Garage Pro, StyleLine, N-Dure, Auto Trust, 4WD Pros and Item Auto items, and for all other items, regardless
            of
            the party at fault. We are also not liable for lost or stolen packages and all such claims must be processed
            through the shipping company.</p>
