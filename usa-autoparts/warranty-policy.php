        <h1>Warranty Policy</h1>

        <p>Our warranty policy covers defective parts and accessories sent by us. We offer a warranty on almost every
            automotive part. Our warranty system does not cover any form of Labor cost. In a situation where it is found
            that a part is defective, first we attempt to replace it and if a replacement is not possible, then we will
            issue a refund for the total amount that has been charged against your purchase. In case a reorder is made
            before the return of the initial part we will require upfront payment for the subsequent part and refund.
        </p>

        <p>When raising return requests to Used Parts Yard, please provide a detailed explanation regarding why the part
            is
            being returned. If a part is returned which does not match the return specification of the part in this
            warranty
            policy, Used Parts Yard will charge a 25% restocking fee from the total paid amount. Used Parts Yard will
            not be
            liable if the customer refuses to claim the item at the given address provided during the time of purchase.
        </p>

        <p>Before ordering, please verify it with a mechanic or a body specialist for ordering the correct part. We will
            not
            initiate any refund and will not accept any returns if the order made by the customer is mistakenly ordered.
            Additionally, the product should be returned within 30 days from the date it was delivered.</p>

        <p>The following are the few exceptional cases that will either void a warranty or are exceptions to our 30 days
            return policy:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Engines are assembled completely comprising manifolds, oil pan, timing covers and belts, fuel injection
                or
                the carburetor, we guarantee only for the long block, not for the manifolds, gaskets, seals, hoses, oil
                pan,
                timing covers, and belts, fuel injection or the carburetor.</li>
            <li>If parts are purchased separately, they will come under warranty.</li>
            <li>Other items such as water pump, distributor cap, spark plugs and wires that may be needed to replace are
                high-wear parts, Used Parts Yard will not be liable for them.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Electrical items for example Engine Computers and Body Control Modules, transmission modules, transfer case
            modules are not for testing purposes, and only guaranteed to have the correct manufacturer part number. All
            electrical items come under the replacement warranty only. We will send up to one replacement order to
            correct a
            non-working module. A module may need to be reset by the dealer. In this case, a part cannot be returned
            until
            the dealer verifies that the part has been improved properly. Additionally, in the case of the electrical
            part
            if altered in any way will not be accepted as a return.</p>

        <p>In the case of struts, sold in working condition will only come under warranty. The actual ride quality of
            the
            shocks or springs does not come under warranty, but we ensure that the springs and strut top will be in
            working
            condition. However, shocks may be modified to enhance ride quality. Control arms are warranted to be
            original
            and straight. The warranty does not cover any rubber bushings or non-metal parts attached to control arms.
        </p>
